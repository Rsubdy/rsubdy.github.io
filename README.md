# SIMPLE INVOICE GENERATOR (POLISH: "PROSTY GENERATOR FAKTUR")

## OVERVIEW
This is a simple generator that allows the User to procure an invoice. I wrote it as an exercise to practice **jQuery** and **CSS**.

In a few quick steps, that are separated by pulsating buttons, the User fills necessary vendor and buyer details and can add one or multiple products with various VAT tax rates. After all is done, the invoice can be printed or saved to file.

The layout is mobile first responsive design.
